{profile_text}

Analyze the job requirements and the candidate's profile. Identify:
1. Which experiences (by index) are most relevant to this job
2. Which skills match the job requirements best
3. Which specific achievements/highlights demonstrate fit

Return your analysis as a JSON object with this exact structure:

  "key_highlights": [
    "Built scalable Django REST API serving 1M+ requests",
    "Led migration from LAMP to Node.js microservices"
  ],
  "relevance_reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these items were selected"
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Only include experiences that are genuinely relevant to THIS job
- Prioritize skills that match job requirements (e.g., Django/Node.js over LAMP if job mentions Python/JavaScript)
- Select highlights that demonstrate fit for the role
- Be selective - quality over quantity
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or extra text"""
