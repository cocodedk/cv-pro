# Phase 1: Foundation – Detailed Action Plans

*Elon Musk's First Principle: Build a solid foundation or crash on launch. Like SpaceX's early Falcon 1 failures, learn from mistakes and iterate.*

## Action 1: GDPR Deep Dive
**Objective**: Ensure 100% compliance to avoid EU fines (up to 4% of global turnover).

**Detailed Plan**:
- **Week 1**: Conduct data mapping audit. Identify all data flows (user inputs, Supabase storage, API calls). Tools: Use automated scanners like OneTrust or GDPR tools.
- **Week 2**: Implement encryption (AES-256 for data at rest/transit). Add consent management (opt-in forms for data processing).
- **Week 3**: Train team on GDPR best practices. Test with mock scenarios.
- **Week 4**: External audit simulation. Fix gaps.

**Resources**: GDPR consultant (€2k), encryption libraries (free).
**Timeline**: 4 weeks.
**Risks**: Data breaches; mitigation: Backup plans.
**Success Metric**: Pass internal audit.

## Action 2: Danish Market Research
**Objective**: Understand Danish job market to tailor product.

**Detailed Plan**:
- **Week 1-2**: Analyze Danish job sites (Jobindex.dk, LinkedIn DK). Collect 1000+ CV samples via web scraping (ethical, GDPR-compliant).
- **Week 3**: AI analysis: Use your existing AI service to identify patterns (e.g., Danish values equality, sustainability).
- **Week 4**: User interviews (20 Danish professionals). Cultural notes: Emphasize work-life balance in features.

**Resources**: Research tools (€1k), AI credits.
**Timeline**: 4 weeks.
**Risks**: Biased data; mitigation: Diverse sampling.
**Success Metric**: Market insights report.

## Action 3: Legal Partnerships
**Objective**: Secure expert legal advice for Denmark/EU.

**Detailed Plan**:
- **Week 1**: Identify 3-5 Danish GDPR firms (via LinkedIn, legal directories).
- **Week 2**: RFP process: Send requirements, get proposals.
- **Week 3**: Select and onboard partner. Initial consultation on app architecture.
- **Week 4**: Ongoing retainer setup.

**Resources**: Legal fees (€5-10k initial).
**Timeline**: 4 weeks.
**Risks**: High costs; mitigation: Fixed retainer.
**Success Metric**: Signed partnership agreement.

## Action 4: Tech Audit
**Objective**: Secure codebase against vulnerabilities.

**Detailed Plan**:
- **Week 1**: Run security scans (OWASP tools on FastAPI/React).
- **Week 2**: Implement fixes: Rate limiting, audit logs, input validation.
- **Week 3**: Beta testing with 50 Danish users for feedback.
- **Week 4**: Penetration testing (hire external firm €2k).

**Resources**: Security tools (free/open-source), testers.
**Timeline**: 4 weeks.
**Risks**: Undiscovered bugs; mitigation: Continuous monitoring.
**Success Metric**: Zero critical vulnerabilities.

**Phase Milestone**: Full compliance audit passed. Total Budget: €10k-20k.
