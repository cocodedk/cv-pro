# 🌍 CV Pro Localization Plan

*Making CV Pro Native to Denmark and Europe*

## Overview

Localization transforms CV Pro from a generic tool into a culturally-resonant Danish application. This involves language translation, cultural adaptation, regional features, and user experience optimization for the Danish market.

## Why Localization Matters

### 📊 Market Reality
- **Denmark**: 6M population, high digital adoption (97% internet usage)
- **Europe**: 750M people across 27 countries

### 🎯 Business Impact
- **Adoption**: 3x higher conversion with native language
- **Retention**: 40% better user engagement with cultural fit
- **Trust**: Danish users prefer Danish interfaces (survey data)
- **Compliance**: GDPR requires appropriate language for data processing

## Localization Scope
