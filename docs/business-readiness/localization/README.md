# 🌍 CV Pro Localization Plan

*Making CV Pro Native to Denmark and Europe*

## Overview

Localization transforms CV Pro from a generic tool into a culturally-resonant Danish application. This involves language translation, cultural adaptation, regional features, and user experience optimization for the Danish market.

## Why Localization Matters

### 📊 Market Reality
- **Denmark**: 6M population, high digital adoption (97% internet usage)
