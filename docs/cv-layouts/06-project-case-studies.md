# Layout 06: Project Case Studies (Long-Scroll Story)

## Best for
- Product/engineering roles where impact storytelling matters

## Visual structure
- Strong summary up top, then 2–4 case studies
- Each case study uses a consistent template: Context → Actions → Results → Tech

## Suggested HTML skeleton
- `header` (hero + key metrics)
- `main`
  - `section` Case studies
    - `article` per project (subsections)
  - `section` Experience (optional, shorter)

## Responsive + print behavior
- Mobile: naturally works
- Print: mixed; enable print mode with “condensed case study” summaries

## Reliability notes
- Keep images optional; provide alt text and avoid image-only diagrams
- Use consistent headings so content is scannable

## Styling cues (Tailwind-friendly)
- Project blocks: border-top separators, strong `h3` headings
- Add “key result” callouts as plain text blocks
